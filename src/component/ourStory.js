                We at Studio Bodhi believe ‘Design’ is a medium which could be used as a trigger in defining the future of Our collective civilization. Studio Bodhi through its long term vision and motto of “Design for All” celebrates the rich knowledge of our land of building communities, culture, art and crafts, built heritage thus connecting the dots of tangible and intangible.

                Our practice associates with the process of exchange of ideas, stories, emotions, flora & fauna, thus weaving & nurturing spaces which celebrates the energy of inclusiveness. Often, these vocabulary of design ideas leads to creating a culture, which defines values and determining the future.
